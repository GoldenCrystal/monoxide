	* ObjectiveC.cs: Added and disabled a tweak for process and
	bundle path. It don't seem to work.
	MutableCopy !

	* System.MacOS.csproj:
	* ControlSize.cs:
	* VerticalAlignment.cs:
	* HorizontalAlignment.cs: 

	* WebView.cs: Small change in the internal native
	initialization procedure.

	* ViewToolbarItem.cs: Rudimentary fix for the new layout
	model. It works for now.

	* Thickness.cs: Lot of operator overloading… Maybe too much ?

	* View.cs: Code cleaned and new layout model. (Still need some
	tweaks, especially for toolbar items, content views, and
	splitviews)
	SplitViews are still broken.
	ScrollViews seem to work somehow. (But they need some work
	nonetheless)

	* Cell.cs: Added the ControlSize property as well as a new
	(and unused yet) measure method.

	* Application.cs: Added Tweaks for the process and bundle… But
	they crash the application when launched as a bundle, so they
	are disabled.
	Removed the setAppleMenu: call for Snow Leopard as it finally
	seems to be unecessary.
	The Application class now provides Mac OSX OSVersion.

	* Window.cs: ContentView is now autosized, yeah !
	The native pointer is registered much earlier, in order to
	prevent possible bugs.

	* AttributedString.cs: To implement.

	* Bundle.cs: Added an AssemblyBundle property
	Can find bundles based on assembly

	* SafeNativeMethods.CoreFoundation.cs: Private methods used
	for tweaks. Disabled by default.

	* CloneFactory.cs: This will be used for reworking a bit the
	current bridging strategy.

	* ObjectiveC.Bridging.cs: Fix for native object copying.

	* SafeNativeMethods.cs: Added methods for NSDictionary.

	* SafeNativeMethods.ApplicationServices.cs: Moved from AppKit

	* ObjectiveC.String.cs: Implementation of a wrapper for CLR
	strings… Not used yet.

	* ObjectiveC.Object.cs: Future implementations for CLRObject
	and futre base implementation for CLR* Objective-C types

	* OSVersion.cs: Use Gestalt to get OSX version info and build
	an OperatingSystem out of it.

	* NativeClassAttribute.cs: Allow the attribute to be used on
	structs.

	* SafeNativeMethods.AppKit.cs: NSRange and NSNotFound added.
	Moved some methods to a new file.

	* SafeNativeMethods.CoreServices.cs: Gestalt Manager ->
	Gestalt API

	* Rectangle.cs: Let the properties be modifiable

	* Size.cs: Some operator goodness, and infinite size.

	* NSDictionary.cs: Helper methods for the native type
	NSDictionary.

	* Memory.cs: Generic memory manipulation wrappers using cpblk
	and initblk.
